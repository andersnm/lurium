## Lurium tools ##

- obj2h - converts many 3d formats to a .h file (uses AssImp)
- bin2h - converts any binary files to a .h file
- control_server - game mode and game server load balancer

## Use cases ##

- Develop, build and package for web and Windows in Visual Studio
- Build and package for Android using Android Studio
- Build and package for iPhone/iOS using Xcode
- Build and package Linux game server tarball using autoconf
- Set up a Linux game server with systemd and nginx
- Set up a Linux load balancing server with systemd and ngingx


# Develop, build and package for web and Windows in Visual Studio #

## Dependencies ##

Required software and dependencies must be installed manually:

- Visual Studio 2015 Community or newer with C++
- Emscripten
- Boost (headers only, not in the repo)

Visual Studio must be configured to find the Boost headers. Additionally, the 
Emscripten project files have hardcoded the path to the Emscripten SDK in the 
build actions. These must be updated if not installed in the default location:

	C:\Program Files\Emscripten\emsdk.bat


# Build and package for Android using Android Studio #

## Dependencies ##

- Android Studio
- LLDB (from SDK Manager)
- Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM Installer) (from SDK Manager)
- NDK (from SDK Manager)
- Boost (manually installed prebuilt binaries)

Open the Android Studio SDK Manager and find the "SDK Tools" tab. It is 
located	here: Tools -> Android -> SDK Manager -> Appearance and Behavior -> 
System Settings -> Android SDK -> SDK Tools

## Install Boost for Android ##

Download the prebuilt binaries of Boost for Android from here: TODO: link

Copy the Boost binaries into NDK's default directory for third party libraries 
where Android Studio can find them. On Windows, this directory is here: 
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\sdk\ndk-bundle\sources

## Build Boost for Android using ndkpkg on WSL ##

The prebuilt binaries does not contain everything yet. The prebuild binaries 
were made with a custom tool called "ndkpkg" - basically a primitive package
manager for NDK. ndkpkg requires a Unix environment such as WSL or Ubuntu.
		
Steps to build Boost for Android in Bash:

	cd ~
	wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r14-linux-x86_64.zip
	sudo apt-get unzip subversion g++
	sudo unzip android-ndk-r14-linux-x86_64.zip -d /opt

	echo 'export ANDROID_NDK=/opt/android-ndk-r14' >> ~/.bashrc
	echo 'export NDK_ROOT=/opt/android-ndk-r14' >> ~/.bashrc
	echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_NDK' >> ~/.bashrc
	source ~/.bashrc

	svn co svn://anders-e.com/ndkpkg/trunk ndkpkg
	cd ndkpkg
	chmod +x ndkpkg.sh

	sudo -E ./ndkpkg.sh boost_1_63_0 android-9 armeabi-v7a
	sudo -E ./ndkpkg.sh boost_1_63_0 android-9 x86
	sudo -E ./ndkpkg.sh boost_1_63_0 android-21 x64


# Set up a Linux game server with systemd and nginx #

	sudo apt-get install g++ make libboost-dev libboost-system-dev \
		libboost-chrono-dev
	tar xzfv lurium-engine-1.0.tar.gz
	./configure && make
	sudo make install

If everything went well, the server binaries should be installed to
/usr/local/bin. Next you want to set up locked down user accounts and install
init scripts for running one or more game modes.

## Install init scripts on Debian ##

	cd debian
	chmod +x install_service.sh
	sudo ./install_service.sh control
	sudo ./install_service.sh nibbles default0 ../nibbles/default0.ini
	sudo ./install_service.sh nibbles small0 ../nibbles/small0.ini

install_service.sh creates:
- locked down user account
- home directory with configuration
- systemd service which restarts automatically after a reboot

Use the systemctl command to manage the services:
	systemctl start control_server.service 
	systemctl stop nibbles_default0.service 
	systemctl status nibbles_small0.service 

# Build and package Linux game server tarball using autoconf #

	sudo apt-get install autoconf 
	autoreconf -i
	./configure
	make dist

If working in the repository and making changes to configure.ac, regenerate configure:

	autoconf

Building Boost for Android

sudo -E ./ndkpkg.sh boost android-21 x86_x64
sudo -E ./ndkpkg.sh boost android-9 x86
sudo -E ./ndkpkg.sh boost android-9 armeabi-v7a

General minimum Android API version requirements for architectures:

x86_64: minimum android-21
The NDK provides native versions of Android APIs for 64-bit x86 machine code starting from Android 5.0 (Android API level 21). If your project files target an older API level, but include x86_64 as a targeted platform, the NDK build script automatically selects the right set of native platform headers and libraries for you.
source: https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/x86-64.html

x86: minimum android-9
x86 support requires, at minimum, Android 2.3 (Android API level 9). If your project files target an older API level, but include x86 as a targeted platform, the NDK build script automatically selects the right set of native platform headers/libraries for you.
source: https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/x86.html

mips: minimum android-9
MIPS support requires, at minimum, Android 2.3 (Android API level 9). If your project files target an older API level, but include MIPS as a targeted platform, the NDK build script automatically selects the right set of native platform headers/libraries for you.
source: https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/mips.html

arm, armeabi-v7a: minimum android-3, effectively android-9
ARM has been supported since the first releases (release 3 is the first one to support native NDK development at all). Since both armeabi and armeabi-v7a link to the same libraries (in the arch-arm subdirectory), both of them are supported since release 3.
